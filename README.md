Women's safety remains an ongoing concern despite efforts to address it. An application that can provide women with quick access to help and empower them to take control of their safety in emergency situations.

## Objectives

- Provide safety to all users registered on the application.

- Reduce the number of hate crimes and boost Morale.

- To provide a centralized access to SOS contacts and Safe locations.

- Hazard avoidance systems such as Fake calls and Alert siren to shimmy of attackers.

- Live Location Tracking


## Idea

The proposed system will be implemented with the help of React application; which will alert the emergency contacts, nearest police station and to nearby users having this application by sending alert messages to them.
 
The location of the victim with the help of GPS tracker system is displayed for anyone responding to them.Â 

The user can use the offline mode in case if the user does not have an internet connection an SMS will be sent to the emergency saved contact .

On pressing SOS button, it will provide information about nearby police stations and nearest safety location.
