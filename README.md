## withU
Women's safety remains an ongoing concern despite efforts to address it. An application that can provide women with quick access to help and empower them to take control of their safety in emergency situations.

## Objectives

- Provide safety to all users registered on the application.

- Reduce the number of hate crimes and boost Morale.

- To provide a centralized access to SOS contacts and Safe locations.

- Hazard avoidance systems such as Fake calls and Alert siren to shimmy of attackers.

- Live Location Tracking


## Idea

The proposed system will be implemented with the help of React Native; which will alert the emergency contacts and to nearby users having this application by sending alert messages to them and SMS to Emergency Contacts.
The SOS is sent to Users within a 5 km radius to promote quick help.
It has a map view which displays the active users.
In the Alert section the alerts are displayed and when a person clicks on Get Direction Button he is redirected to Google Maps and Navigation is started.
The Help tab has a Map View that displays the nearby Hospitals and Police Stations along the Contact Info is also accessible.


## How is withU different ?

- Increased reach: The traditional SOS system only contacts emergency services. In contrast, withU can alert the user's emergency contacts, and nearby users within the community icreasing the reach of the alert.

- Real-time location sharing: The app shares the victim's location in real-time, which can help responders locate the victim quickly. This feature is not available in the traditional SOS system.

- User-friendly: The app is developed using React Native, which is known for creating user-friendly interfaces. 

- Community building: Since the app also sends alerts to users within the community, it promotes trust and a level of comfort for everyone around. It ultimately benefits the communityâ€™s Safety and peace as a whole.
